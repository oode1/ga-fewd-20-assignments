# FEWD Homework
## Week 8; 01-Basics

1. Copy all the files from `starter_code/` into the `completed/` directory,
   which is where you will do all of your completed homework.

2. In the `completed/` directory, you will see 5 html files.  Open each of
   those files in Sublim Text, where you will find the specific homework
   assignment instructions at the top of each file.

3. You should open each of the corresponding files in the `solution/` directory
   to see examples of expected behaviour for each of those files.
