# Week 8; 01-Basics; Question 5;

The goal of this is to make a basic addition calculator.
Here are some steps towards doing that:

1. Make a form

2. Inside the form, make two input with type of "number".

3. When the form is submitted, add the numbers from both
   inputs, and display the final value inside of a `window.alert(...)`
