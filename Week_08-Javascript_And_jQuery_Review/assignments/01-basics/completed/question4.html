1. Make 1 box.

2. Make 2 forms, each with 1 input button.

3. When Form 1 is submitted, the background color
   of Box 1 should become red.

4. When Form 2 is submitted, the background color
   of Box 1 should become blue.

OTES:

* Remember that any function that is the callback for
  a form submit must always have a `return false`
  at the end of the function.
