  Lab: Selectors/Pseudoclass

  In this lab, you will be using this file to practice and demonstrate
  use of CSS Pseudo-Class selectors.

  At first, you will practice using the `:hover` pseudo-class.
  Then, in the later lab, you will practice using the `:first-child`
  pseudo-class.

  For practicing with `:hover`, do this:

  1. Add some `<a>` elements to the HTML
  2. In the CSS, add some CSS rules that make use of the `:hover`
     pseudo-class selector to change various properties
     of those `<a>` elements.
  3. Test your changes in the browser.  You can make changes directly in the dev tools
     for quick testing.

  For practicing with `:first-child`, do this:

  1. Add multiple `<article>` elements to a `<section>` element.
  2. In your CSS, add some CSS rules that only apply to the first `<article>`
     using the `first-child` pseudo-class selector.
